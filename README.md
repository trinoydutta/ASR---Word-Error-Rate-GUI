# ASR---Word-Error-Rate-GUI
This is an interactive GUI where you can enter some ground truth and hypothesis/asr-output to compute the Word Error Rate. It shows the evaluation.

N = total number of letter or words in a sentence
S = number of substitutions
I = number of insertions
D = number of deletions

A lower WER means a better performing system

This module uses zszyellow's WER-in-Python to calculate WER.
